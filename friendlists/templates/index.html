        Facebook's friendlist management isn't the best. This small app tries to
        ease that pain. After logging in, you select a friendlist to edit. It'll
        show two columns: unlisted and listed. You can move friends from and to
        lists by clicking on the buttons between them. Once you're done, click
        "Save changes".
